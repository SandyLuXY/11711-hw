1. The code is adapted from https://github.com/monologg/GoEmotions-pytorch
2. use command "python3 run_goemotions.py --taxonomy original" to train
 the model, however, since the dataset is large, we do not include it in the folder
3. demoji.ipynb is how we process the emojis and emoticons in the dataset
4. emoji2vec.ipynb is how we extract embedding from emojis
5. use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required environments
